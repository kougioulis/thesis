In this work, we introduced \textit{Large Causal Models} (LCMs), a family of foundation models for temporal causal discovery trained on large-scale datasets of time-series and corresponding ground-truth causal graphs. By leveraging a diverse mixture of synthetic and realistically generated datasets, our LCMs achieve strong generalization across domains and demonstrate competitive or superior performance to existing methods that require dataset-specific training, while operating in constant time, both at in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.
