This thesis marks the culmination of a long journey into the world of causality. Work presented here builds upon collaborative efforts between the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas in Heraklion and Huawei Ireland Research Centre in Dublin, Ireland. It forms parts of a broader initiative that brought together academic research and industrial perspectives on developing robust causal discovery methods for real-world applications.

Writing these pages has proven to be both a technical challenge and a personal journey, including multiple setbacks, experimental loops as well as positive surprises and breakthroughs. I hope that this work will not only contribute to advancing robust causal discovery methods for decision making, but also inspire further research in building machine learning systems that can reason about the world, instead of merely recognizing patterns.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would first like to thank my advisor for guidance and pointers towards this work, on a novel line of research that was not without its own challenges and struggles. His vision has shaped much of the presented material. A special thanks goes to Dr. Nikolaos Gkorgkolis, as both a collaborator and postdoctoral mentor, whose insight and directions are evident along these pages. I am grateful for our thoughtful discussions, creative ideas, countless meetings, software engineering, research writing and planning. I also want to thank all members of the AIOps team at Huawei Ireland Research Centre: Wang MingXue, who led this collaboration; Bora Caglayan, Andrea Tonon and Dario Simionato, for bridging the gap between the two teams with patience. Working with such talented people has been a rewarding aspect of this voyage. Finally, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my family for their unwavering love and encouragement. They have always been next to me along this journey. This includes my mother Sofia, my father Michalis and my brother Christos. Nothing in my life would have been possible without them.
