This chapter provides a detailed treatment of the training process of our LCMs. It serves as an extension of our high-level discussion in Section \ref{sec:dl}, but tailored specifically towards the training of our LCMs. We begin by outlining the basic components of our training process and the associated challenges, before moving on to the main objectives of our work.
